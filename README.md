## Personal Learnings
Below are the subsequent learning outcomes.

### Comparison Operators
- == (loose)
- === (strict, checks for typeOf)

### Switch Statement
```js
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    code block
    break;
  case y:
    code block
    break;
  default:
    code block
}
```

### Arrow Function
- Shorter syntax for function expressions and they are not hoisted. 
```js
const x = (x, y) => { return x * y };
```
